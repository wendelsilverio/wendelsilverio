**Hello World, I'm Wendel!**

_About me_

I really enjoy being on the computer💻 developing software, my mind floats in abstraction.

My mind is in a brain🧠 that is in a body that needs physical exercise🏋️, quality food🥗 and fun to function properly and I need to dedicate myself a little more to this...

Money💵 was one of the best inventions created by humanity, through it I can obtain food, study, entertainment and comfort.

The family👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 is my treasure, I feel more human with it, I feel my emotions💓, affections and zeal and even the moments of disagreement make me reflect on my life.

And so I lead my lifestyle always looking for balance! ⚖️🎣🥕
